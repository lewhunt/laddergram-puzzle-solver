#Laddergram Word Puzzle Solver
A utility app written in JavaScript that generates the shortest amount of words from a dictionary - between start and end words - where each term differs by just one letter. Such lists are often used in Word Ladder puzzle games.

### Notes
This app is primiarily for learning purposes and further customization. It is not intended as a complete drop-in solution.

The JavaScript code makes use of linked lists and Queue data structures to efficiently process the dictionary results. It's funny to see the app grind away when long word ladders are generated - see screengrab :-)
